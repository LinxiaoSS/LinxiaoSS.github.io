Welcome to Prof. Linxiao Shen's research group at the Peking University. Please visit our PKU website: http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/linxiaoshen
Our research focuses on:

* Analog, mixed-signal, and RF integrated circuits;
* High-Performance Analog Front-Ends for Sensor Applications
* Imaging systems
* Analog/Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuit Design and Layout Automation
  
SHEN LAB received a number of awards for his research contributions, including **2024 IEEE CICC Outstanding Student Paper Award**, **2023 IEEE ISSCC the Anathan P. Chandraksan Distinguished-Technical-Paper Award**, 2018-2019 IEEE Solid State Circuits Society Predoctoral Achievement Award, 2019 the UT Austin Cockrell School of Engineering Fellowship, 2011 the Samsung Fellowship, and 2012 the National scholarship. He serves on the Technical Program Committee of the IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC). He was on the Technical Program Committee of ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference. He was an Associate Editor of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—PART I: REGULAR PAPERS.

Research Interests
======

Welcome to Linxiao Shen’s homepage. My research focuses on:
* Highly energy-efficient sensor interface circuits and systems design
* High-performance analog and mixed-signal circuits design
* Power-management integrated circuits (PMICs) design for system-on-chip module
* Ultra-high-speed transceiver, optical coherent transceiver, high-speed ADC


**I am always looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with background in analog/digital/mixed-signal integrated circuit, electrical engineering, mathematics, statistics, and/or related areas, working on research fields of**

* High-performance ADC design (focus on speed, resolution, and power efficiency)
* High-performance analog front-ends with sensor co-design/integration
