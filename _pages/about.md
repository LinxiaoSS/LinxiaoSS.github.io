Linxiao Shen received his Ph.D. degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Texas at Austin in 2019. He is now an analog/mixed-signal designer in Silicon Laboroteris Inc., mainly working on ultra-low-power MCU and its peripherals, including ultra-low power on-chip clock generation, ultra-low power power management circuits and systems design. He is also a researcher in Dr. [Nan Sun](https://www.cerc.utexas.edu/~nansun/)'s research group, leading the projects of high-speed ADC design and high-performance biomedical readout circuits design. Dr. Shen received the B.S. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China in 2014. 

Mr. Shen is recipient of the 2018-2019 IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society Predoctoral Achievement Award, 2019-2020 UT Austin Graduate Continuing Fellowship, 2012 Chinese National scholarship, and 2011 Samsung Fellowship. He has served as a reviewer for IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuit (JSSC), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and System I, Regular Papers (TCAS-I), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and System II: Express Briefs (TCAS-II), IEEE Transactions on Very-Large Scale Integrated Systems (TVLSI), Microelectronics Journal (MEJ), and IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS).
