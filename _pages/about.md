Welcome to Prof. Linxiao Shen's research group at the Peking University. Our research focuses on:

Analog, mixed-signal, and RF integrated circuits;
High-Performance Analog Front-Ends for AIoT Sensor Applications
Low-cost AIoT systems;
Analog/Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuit Design and Layout Automation
I am an assistant professor in the School of Integrated Circuits at Peking University. Previously, I worked as an analog/mixed-signal designer in Silicon Laboroteris Inc., mainly working on ultra-low-power MCU (Micro-Controller) and its peripherals, including ultra-low power on-chip clock generator, ultra-low-power power management circuits and systems design. I received the Ph.D. degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Texas at Austin in 2019, advised by Prof. Nan Sun and the B.S. degree (Ranked 1st) from Fudan University, Shanghai, China in 2014. I am a recipient of the 2018-2019 IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society Predoctoral Achievement Award, 2019-2020 UT Austin Graduate Continuing Fellowship, etc. 

Research Interests
======

Welcome to Linxiao Shenâ€™s homepage. My research focuses on:
* Highly energy-efficient sensor interface circuits and systems design
* High-performance analog and mixed-signal circuits design
* Power-management integrated circuits (PMICs) design for system-on-chip module
* Ultra-high-speed transceiver, optical coherent transceiver, high-speed ADC


**I am always looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with background in analog/digital/mixed-signal integrated circuit, electrical engineering, mathematics, statistics, and/or related areas, working on research fields of**

* High-performance ADC design (focus on speed, resolution, and power efficiency)
* High-performance analog front-ends with sensor co-design/integration
