Linxiao Shen is now a PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Texas at Austin. He is now in Dr. [Nan Sun](https://www.cerc.utexas.edu/~nansun/)'s research group. Mr. Shen received the B.S. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China in 2014. His doctoral work involves the design of energy-efficient sensor readout circuits, mainly for biomedical circuits. He was an intern with analog group at Silicon Laboratories Inc. from Jun. to Aug. 2018, working on low-power RC oscillator design. 

Mr. Shen is recipient of the 2018-2019 IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society Predoctoral Achievement Award, 2012 National scholarship, and 2011 Samsung Fellowship. He has interned at Silicon Laborotories Inc. He has served as a reviewer for IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and System I/II (TCAS-I/II).
